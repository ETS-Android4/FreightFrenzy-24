/**
 * This file provides basic Telop driving for a Phoebe robot.
 * The code is structured as an Iterative OpMode
 * <p>
 * This OpMode uses the common Phoebe hardware class to define the devices on the robot.
 * All device access is managed through the HardwarePhoebe class.
 * <p>
 * This particular OpMode executes a basic Tank Drive Teleop for a Phoebe
 * It raises and lowers the claw using the Gampad Y and A buttons respectively.
 * It also opens and closes the claws slowly using the left and right Bumper buttons.
 * <p>
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
